This hospital tower was built according to the out of the box instructions. A lighting kit was purchased, which provided the flashing lights for the ambulance and helicopter.

The lighting kit also contained white and yellow LED lights for the hospital tower itself. These were connected to one of the Arduino servers in the Lego Data Center and were lit only when a portion of the hospital was hacked by an attendee.
