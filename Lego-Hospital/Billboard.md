# Billboard

The billboard is a Kindle Fire 2nd Generation tablet, which runs a customized Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich OS. This cost me $0, I won it from a vendor at a Security Conference in 2011 in New York City. It has been rooted, and for SaintCon, was running a Google Chrome browser
- Connected to EAZYBillboardsLTD Wifi with a set IP address of 192.168.42.5
- Google Chrome browser is open to the web page at http://192.168.42.2
- There is no lock code on the tablet, but after power-up, it does need to be unlocked with a finger swipe
- It is enclosed in a custom-built Lego enclosure, built out of light and dark grey bricks from a variety of Lego kits.
