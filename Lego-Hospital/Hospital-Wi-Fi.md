# Hospital Wi-Fi

The Hospital private networ Wi-Fi was hosted by an Netgear Router that I bought at a local thrift store for $6.00

- Netgear R6700v3
- Router IP: 192.168.1.1
- ESSID: STCONHOSPITAL
- Password: SooperSecre7!
- DHCP: 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.250

After a factory reset, it was configured as above, with a few additional hardening steps taken:

- Perform a 30-30-30 factory reset
- Change Admin password
- Router IP
- ESSID
- DHCP Range
- DHCP Address Reservations
- Disable USB Functions
- Disable UPnP
- Disable Any USB Device
