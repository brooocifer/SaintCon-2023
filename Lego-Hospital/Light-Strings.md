# Light Strings

4 LED Light strings were used to represent different hacking scenarios. These light strings were strung among the different Lego Hospital buildings, the Lego House, the Lego Data Center, and the Lego Cloud. Purchased LED light strings that were connected to the ESP8266 servers in the data center had their USB connectors clipped off and wires stripped in order to connect them via the screw terminals.
